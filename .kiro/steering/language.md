# Language Guidelines

## Documentation Language
- All documentation, code comments, and written materials must be in English
- This includes:
  - README files
  - Code comments
  - API documentation
  - Technical specifications
  - Commit messages
  - Issue descriptions

## Chat Communication
- Respond to users in the same language they use to communicate
- If a user writes in Japanese, respond in Japanese
- If a user writes in English, respond in English
- Maintain consistency within a conversation thread

## Code Standards
- Variable names, function names, and class names should be in English
- Use clear, descriptive English names for all identifiers
- Comments explaining complex logic should be in English

## Rationale
This approach ensures:
- International accessibility of documentation
- Consistent codebase language
- Natural communication experience for users
- Professional documentation standards
